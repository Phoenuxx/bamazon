# Runazon

#Summary
Bamazon, or Runazon for all you runners out there (Shadowrun theme by the way), is a store front for purchasing various 
mechandise with a persistant database. As a customer you can select goods using the item's ID number and then select the
amount you would like to purchase. The Vendor will then let you know how many credits are owed for your purchase.

#Customer
No special keywords or commands/actions are needed for the Customer potion of this app, simply select and item via the ID and
state how many you would like to purchase when prompted. If there are not enough in stock the Vendor will let you know and
ask if you would like to purchase something else or give you the option to exit the store and quit wasting his time!

#Manager 

The manager portion is half functional, currently you can view the current inventory as well as a list of items with "low" (<5>) stock.
To login:
-Username is whatever you want it to be
-Password is simply "password"
